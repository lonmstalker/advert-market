# Memory Bank Entrypoint

Use [00-index.md](./00-index.md) as the canonical navigation map.

Policy notes:
- New or heavily rewritten documentation must be written in English.
- Legacy bilingual content is allowed until migration is complete.
- Consistency is enforced by `scripts/check-memory-bank-consistency.mjs`.
