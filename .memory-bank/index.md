# Memory Bank Entrypoint

Use [00-index.md](./00-index.md) as the canonical navigation map.

Policy notes:
- All memory bank documentation is English-only.
- Russian i18n examples are allowed only in escaped `\uXXXX` form (no Cyrillic glyphs).
- Consistency is enforced by `scripts/check-memory-bank-consistency.mjs`.
